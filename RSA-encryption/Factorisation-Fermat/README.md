# Fermat's Factorisation

Prerequisites:
1. [RSA Encryption/Decryption](https://github.com/ashutosh1206/Crypton/blob/master/RSA-encryption/README.md)

Fermat's Factorisation is based on the representation of odd integer as difference of two squares:

This difference is factorable as **(a+b)*(a-b)**
